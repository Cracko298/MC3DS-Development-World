# MC3DS-Development-World
A "new" Minecraft 3DS Development World, based off of the Dev. World that was created by and removed by DeadSkullzJr.

## NOTICE:
- This is a recreation of the Original Development World.
- It aims to be as accurate to the original to allow cross compatibility between stuff made with the Original.
- This World is not a direct rip of DeadSkullzJr's World however, it takes alot of inspiration from it.

## Download?
- It's only avaliable on the [MC-3DS UniStore](https://github.com/Minecraft-3DS-Community/minecraft-3ds-unistore), and requires an Install (via Checkpoint or JKSM) to the ExtData.
